However, the database community is missing a synthetic data generator, which analysts could use to study indoor space algorithms. Such generator is needed for two reasons: (1) It can be used to simulate high volumes of mobility data to evaluate location-dependent queries/algorithms. (2) It can provide the additional \"ground truth\" for the synthetic mobility models generated in (1), given the discrete nature of simulated mobility data.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrates a generic, user-configurable toolkit for generating different types of indoor mobility data for real-world buildings. Our prototype generates the desired data in a three-layer pipeline: 1) The *Infrastructure Layer* accepts\r\nindustry-standard DBI files to generate the host indoor environment, allowing for users to configure the generation of a variety of positioning devices, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RFID etc. 2) The *Moving Object Layer* offers the functionality of defining a set of objects or trajectories, with configurable indoor moving patterns, distribution models as well as sampling frequencies. 3) The *Positioning Layer* generates raw RSSI measurements according to the positioning device data and trajectory\r\ndata generated at relevant layers. It also generates different types of indoor positioning data through the customization of all typical indoor positioning methods on the raw RSSI data.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n+ Huan Li, Zhejiang University, China\r\n+ Hua Lu, Aalborg University, Denmark\r\n+ Xin Chen, Zhejiang University, China\r\n+ Gang Chen, Zhejiang University, China\r\n+ Ke Chen, Zhejiang University, China\r\n+ Lidan Shou, Zhejiang University, China\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nEmail Address: lihuancs@zju.edu.cn\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
